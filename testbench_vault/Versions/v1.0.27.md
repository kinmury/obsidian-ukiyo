## Fixes
### General

- **Folder Indent Line** - Fixed position
- **\[\[Links]]**
	- The size of the popover note now adapts to the width and height of the note
	- Said popover won't hide anymore the link below itself, so that you can still click the link without moving the cursor to the link icon of the popover
- **Menu/Red Items** - Subtle issues fixed (when hover over the "Remove" option, the `svg` icon and the text transition on different speed and, in some cases, the color intensity was different)
- **PDF** - Subtle issues fixed (such as the highlight having unnecessary top and bottom padding)
