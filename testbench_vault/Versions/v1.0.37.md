# Ukiyo V1.0.37

> ==Obsidian Version== - `0.15.9`

## New

- **New Sidebars** - The side bars "are not" part of the workspace as before. Instead, the sidebars hover over the note (or the root workspace)
	- This means that the note wont change his display when either sidebar is opened
	- By default, said sidebars will have a lower opacity when not hovered over them
- **Metadata Callout** - `> [!metadata]` - New callout design added to the theme. (I use it for metadata, put it can be used for anything you want)
	- An icon will appear on reading mode, on the top left side of the note. Once you hover said icon, the callout will appear, showing his content
		- *Warning* - You can write more than one metadata callout, put you can only access (on reading mode) to last one
	- This callout can be seen on the note and the popover view of said note, but not when you embed the note on another note

## Improved

- **Light Mode** - *Ukiyo* - There's a new light mode color design for the default color scheme
- **Modals** - The settings modals are smaller
- **Side Docks** - Now are easier to hover over them
- **Prompt Input Border** - Gone
- **Popover** - Box shadow added

## Fixed

- **Note Size** - Now the note size when *readable line length* is active is wider than default
- **Banner Plugin** - The banners are not affected by the general CSS of the theme, so it works as expected
- **Sidebars** - Removed unnecessary horizontal scroll
