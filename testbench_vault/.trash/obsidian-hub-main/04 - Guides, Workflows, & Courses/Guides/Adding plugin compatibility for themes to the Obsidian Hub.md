# Adding plugin compatibility for themes to the Obsidian Hub

We use some scripts to get content from a theme's GitHub repo. If your theme supports the [[obsidian-style-settings|Style Settings]] plugin, we'll automatically classify your plugin under [[Themes with Friendly Settings]], parse the contents of the settings, and add them to your theme's note.

## Plugin Compatibility

If you want to let your users know which plugins you have considered while designing your theme, you can add them to your CSS file as a comment with the following syntax:

```css
/* @plugins
core:
- <plugin-id>
- ...

community:
- <plugin-id>
- <plugin-id>
- ...
*/
```

You can get the plugin IDs for both core and community plugins from their notes here on the hub:

- Community plugins: You can browse the folder [[üóÇÔ∏è Plugins|Community plugins]]
- Core plugins are listed in [[05 - Concepts/Obsidian Core Plugins]]


If you want the hub to ignore some of the settings shown by the [[obsidian-style-settings|Style Settings]] plugin, you can add an attribute `hub: ignore`. 

You can see examples of the `@plugins` block on the [shimmering focus](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus/blob/1c288794b58322e923ec950c0c29cfeea5b5370c/obsidian.css#L4052) theme. An example of the usage of `hub: ignore` can be found [here](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus/blob/1c288794b58322e923ec950c0c29cfeea5b5370c/obsidian.css#L4208).
