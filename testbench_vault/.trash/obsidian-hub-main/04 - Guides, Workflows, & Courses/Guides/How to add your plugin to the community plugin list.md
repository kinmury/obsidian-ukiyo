# How to add your plugin to the community plugin list

This note is based on the instructions of the [obsidian sample plugin readme](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin#adding-your-plugin-to-the-community-plugin-list).

## Preparing your repository

1.   [[How to release a new version of your plugin|Publish an initial version]] of your plugin.
2.   Make sure you have a `README.md` file in the root of your repo, clearly describing the plugins purpose and providing clear usage instructions.
3.  Add a license to your repository. You can use [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/) if you don't know which one to pick.
4.  Check that your `manifest.json` is at the root of your repo. 

## Submitting your plugin

1.  Fork the [obsidian-releases](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases#community-plugins) repo and edit the `community-plugins.json` file. If you prefer to do it from GitHub's web interface, you can follow this instructions, but submit your changes as described in [[How to add content through GitHub]] or [[How to add your plugin to the community plugin list#Submitting your plugin]]. 
2.  Add the information of your plugin at the end of the list (Don't forget to add a comma after the last plugin!). For your convenience you can copy this template and paste it at the end of the list:
	```json
    {
		"id": ""
        "name": "",
        "author": "",
		"description": ""
        "repo": "<github username>/<repository>",
		"branch": "master"
    }
	```
3. Fill out the information of your plugin. Below you can find the description of each field (taken from the [obsidian-releases](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases#community-plugins) repo):
	-   `id`: A unique ID for your plugin. Make sure this is the same one you have in your `manifest.json`.
	-   `name`: The name of your plugin. This will be used to search for your plugin.
	-   `author`: The author's name.
	-   `description`: A short description of what your plugin does.
	-   `repo`: The GitHub repository identifier, in the form of `user-name/repo-name`, if your GitHub repo is located at `https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`.
	-   `branch`: (optional) A branch if you prefer to use a specific branch of your repo. Defaults to `master`.
4.  Make a pull request at [https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases) to add your plugin.
5. Once you've opened the PR, you'll be prompted to use the pull request template. Complete everything in it and submit.

6. Your plugin will go through a small review process. Once your plugin is approved, the PR will be merged and users will be able to install it from the community plugin list.
