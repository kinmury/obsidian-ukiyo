# How to add content through GitHub?

If you're familiar with git, you can skip this guide and directly make a *pull request*. If you don't know what that is, don't worry! This guide explains how to submit changes to this vault through GitHub's web interface. 

We assume you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/), and you've downloaded and edited the contents of this vault as described in [[CONTRIBUTING|how to contribute]].

1. Find the file you want to edit on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-hub)
2. To edit a file, click on the little pencil on the top-right corner
	![[github-edit-file.png]]
	To create a new file, navigate to the folder you want to add the file to, and then click on `Add file`. There you can upload the note you just created or create it using the editor (more about that on step 3):
	![[github-add-new-file.png]]
	GitHub will show you a notice explaining that it has *created a fork* for you. That just means that GitHub has made a copy of the repository you are trying to edit under your account. Don't worry too much about it though!

The good news is that once you have this *fork*, any time you try to edit a note through GitHub's interface, it will save it on your copy!

3. Now it's time to make some changes! Since you've edited this note using Obsidian, just replace the contents on the web interface with the edits you made on Obsidian:

4. Once you're done, scroll to the bottom of the page and add a title (and optionally a description) to your changes (e.g. what you changed or why you made a change):
	![[github-propose-changes.png]]
5. Once you press on `Propose changes`, GitHub will show you the changes you've made by showing the original file and the file in your *fork* side by side (1). Once you have reviewed that the changes are correct, go ahead and press the `Create pull request` button (2).

6. Now you can open a *pull request* (sometimes abbreviated as *PR*). This just means that you want to submit the changes on your *fork* to another repository (in this case the "original" one). 

	On some repositories you'll need to fill out a template (that should be the case for this repo!). On others, GitHub might be able to fill out the title and description based on your changes; if you made multiple changes, you might need to add a new title that summarizes them and (optionally) a small description.

7. Congratulations! You've succesfully submitted a *PR*!
