# How to update your Plugins and CSS for Obsidian 0.13+

**Target audience**: Authors of Plugins, Themes and CSS snippets

This is a collection of information and notes being gathered, to collate information, hints and tips for authors of Plugins, Themes and CSS snippets, to update them so that they work with [Live Preview Mode](https://twitter.com/obsdmd/status/1458523572448727051), as well as with the earlier Edit and Preview modes.

Additions to this page are very much welcomed, as developers and users learn more about any changes needed to support Obisidian Extensions as the software evolves.

The eventual goal is to end up with a table with two columns, where each row lists a piece of old code, and then what to replace it with, to modernise code - and another table for CSS.

## Abbreviations

- CM: [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net)
- CM5: CodeMirror 5
- CM6: CodeMirror 6

## For Plugin Developers

### The Editor Interface

From `@licat`:

> The Editor interface is purposefully designed to be a drop in replacement of CodeMirror 5's object for anything that we support. The migration should be as straightforward as changing the object reference to the editor instead of `sourceMode.cm`. If a plugin is using more advanced API on CodeMirror 5 then we don't support it anyway, and it just won't work on CodeMirror 6 regardless.

- There is now a .is-live-preview class on div.markdown-source-view which will allow you to differentiate live preview from source mode for CSS styling purposes

### Obsidian DOMs

From [[nothingislost]]

#### Environments

Here's my take on the modes, DOM wise. Licat can correct me if I'm wrong on any of this ðŸ™‚

Different Obsidian Desktop environments:

- **Desktop CM5: Editor** <- Original
- **Desktop CM6: Editor (Source)** <- New
- **Desktop CM6: Editor (Live Preview)** <- New
- **Desktop: Preview** <- Original

Different Obsidian Mobile environments:

- **Mobile CM6: Editor (Source)** <- Around since the inception of mobile
- **Mobile: Preview** <- Around since the inception of mobile

Equivalences:

- **Desktop CM6: Editor (Source)** == **Mobile CM6: Editor (Source)**
- **Desktop: Preview** == **Mobile: Preview**

#### The DOMs

- **Desktop CM6: Editor (Live Preview)** should be very similar, DOM wise, to **Desktop CM6: Editor (Source)** with the exception that inactive markdown tokens are replaced with a zero width space.
- **Desktop CM6: Editor (Live Preview)** also has the added distinction that it can now have embedded content rendered in it which adds new DOM elements into the CM6 Editor DOM. These elements should look pretty similar to their preview mode counterparts but we'll probably want to wait until things stabilize before their structure is documented.

### Code Snippets

#### Detect if Live Preview is supported

If you need to write code whose behaviour depends on whether Live Preview is supported (such as during the porting process):

```typescript
// Version 1: Not recommended, as it needs @ts-ignore
//@ts-ignore
if (this.app.vault.config?.livePreview) {
    // Running new Obsidian, that supports Live Preview
} else {
    // Running pre-Live Preview version of Obsidian
}
```

```typescript
// Version 2: Bit better, as no need for @ts-ignore
if ((this.app.vault as any).config?.livePreview) {
    // Running new Obsidian, that supports Live Preview
} else {
    // Running pre-Live Preview version of Obsidian
}
```

Even better would be to wrap the check in to a helper function such as `isLivePreviewSupported()`, so that the logic is in only one place, and can be updated easily if needed.

### Example Code for Updating Plugins

## For Theme Developers

- `.CodeMirror-line` has changed to `.cm-line`
- active line has a new selector (`.cm-active`), that needs to be added for active line highlighting
- Cursor styling has a new selector (`.cm-s-obsidian .cm-cursor`)
- fold markers (the "..." when a a heading / list item is folded) has a new selector (`.cm-foldPlaceholder`)
- the gutter has a new selector (`.markdown-source-view.mod-cm6 .cm-gutters`)
- the css class for the search/replace modal (`.document-search-container`) does not have `position: relative` by default anymore, so you need to add that when the theme moves the location of that modal
- Collapse indicators in Edit Mode are not part of the Code mirror line anymore, meaning they cannot be targeted individually anymore.
- Live preview being a hybrid of edit and reading mode also shares certain css classes with *both*, meaning some css targeting elements in reading/edit mode will probably unintentionally target live preview as well. 
	- Example: `.external` is used to style external links in Reading Mode, but is now used in Live preview as well. 
	- Mostly, these issues can be solved via more specific selectors, e.g. `a.external` for Reading Mode and `span.external` for Edit Mode
- trailing whitespace have a CSS class now, allowing to target them, e.g. 

```css
.cm-line .cm-trailing-space-new-line::before {
	content: "\21B5";
}
```

From `@licat`:

> With respect to themes, we try our best to maintain the same css classes and DOM structure as we possibly can when migrating to CM6. Some changes are inevitable due to how the new underlying editor works, but since CM6 has been in effect for mobile since day 1, most actively updated themes that works well on mobile should work similarly well for Live Preview

### Example Code for Updating Themes
