# Pre-existing H1

This test ensures that the code correctly replaces the contents of
any existing file lists, between the delimiters, and retains
other content unchanged.

## MOC

**IMPORTANT**: Please do not update these Zoottelkeeper comments in the test input
sample-existing-moc-1.md: they are testing backwards-compatibility

%% Zoottelkeeper: Beginning of the autogenerated index file list  %%

If you see this text in the approved file, then the test has FAILED,
as text inside the delimiters has not been replaced...

%% Zoottelkeeper: End of the autogenerated index file list  %%
