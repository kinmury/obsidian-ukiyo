We have collected a number of issues that are a great for getting started and helping with the development
and documentation of plugins.

The following lists are automatically generated, so some descriptions might be a bit cryptic.

## Good first issue

The following issues are good for beginners wanting to help with fixing issues and adding features or documentation.

{% for issue in good_first_issue %}
- [[{{ issue.pluginID }}|{{ issue.plugin }}]] - [{{ issue.title }}]({{ issue.url }})
{% endfor %}

## Help wanted

The plugin developer is looking for help with these issues.
This may be a result of a number of factors:
- wanting to introduce newcomers to the project
- the inability to properly address the issue/implement the feature request
- or simple time constraints
- and many more

These issues might not always be easy to solve.

{% for issue in help_wanted %}
- [[{{ issue.pluginID }}|{{ issue.plugin }}]] - [{{ issue.title }}]({{ issue.url }})
{% endfor %}

## Documentation

These plugins could use some help with documenting features/issues or improving the documentation as a whole.
See also [[Volunteer Plugin Doc Writers]] for some more developers that want help with writing documentation.

{% for issue in documentation %}
- [[{{ issue.pluginID }}|{{ issue.plugin }}]] - [{{ issue.title }}]({{ issue.url }})
{% endfor %}

{% include "footer.md.jinja" %}
