## What is the Obsidian Hub?

Welcome! This is an experimental vault that is maintained by the Obsidian community. 

For best results we recommend [downloading this vault]( https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-hub/releases/latest) locally and opening it in Obsidian or browsing it in our [publish site](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub).

This vault was inspired by the [awesome-obsidian](https://github.com/kmaasrud/awesome-obsidian) list.
