# Where is the .obsidian directory?

The `.obsidian` folder is ignored by git, so anyone loading this repo in to Obsidian, in order to modify content, needs to set up the Obsidian settings themselves.

## Obsidian Settings for Editing Content

For editing content, the requirements are minimal.

They are documented in the [CONTRIBUTING](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/CONTRIBUTING) page, under section "Setup & Vault Consistency".

## Argentum's Settings

Argentum has kindly provided a Zipped copy of the `.obsidian` directory from a properly-configured hub vault.

You can find the download in [wiki](https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-hub/wiki/Obsidian-Settings-for-Developers).
