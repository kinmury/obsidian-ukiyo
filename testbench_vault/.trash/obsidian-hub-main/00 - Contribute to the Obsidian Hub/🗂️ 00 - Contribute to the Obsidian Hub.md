# 🗂️ 00 - Contribute to the Obsidian Hub

==ℹ️ Are you a first time contributor? [[CONTRIBUTING|Head over to here on a primer on how to get started]].==

---

In this folder, you can find all the resources you need to make contributions to the collective knowledge base of the Obsidian Community – this Community Vault. To keep this community vault manageable and consistent, we have standardized [[🗂️ 01 Templates|Templates for new pages]] and a [[Tag glossary]]. Furthermore, we use [[🗂️ 02 Attachments|one central attachment folder]], where all images and other attachments are stored.

Got some question left? Check out the [[FAQ]] or drop by in the `#hub` at [the Obsidian Discord Server](https://discord.gg/veuWUTm) Wondering how a certain tag is used? Refer to the [[Tag glossary]].

Want to know more about behind-the-scenes tending to this Community Vault? Check out the [[🗂️ 03 Contributor Notes|Contributor Notes]].
