# Adding footers 

The script `add_footer.py` examines the current Hub vault contents and adds the footers if needed.

## Running the script

To run it:

```bash
cd obsidian-hub/.github/scripts
python3 ./add_footer.py
```

And then review the changes and commit them.

This can be done by hand, but we also have a [[update_hub GitHub Action|GitHub Action]] that runs it. However, this action [[GitHub Actions for the Hub#^3df057|executes other update scripts as well]]. 

%% Hub footer: Please don't edit anything below this line %%
