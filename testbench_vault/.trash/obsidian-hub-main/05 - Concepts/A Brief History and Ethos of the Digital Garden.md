If you have ever wanted to know what a [[Digital garden]] is, this note from Maggie's own digital garden gives a great overview. As a small sneak peak, here is her definition:

> A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory â€“ notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.
