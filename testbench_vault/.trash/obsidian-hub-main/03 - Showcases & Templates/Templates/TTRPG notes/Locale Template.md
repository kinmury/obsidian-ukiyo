# Locale Template

> I use this template for smaller locations like Buildings, Lots, etc. for my D&D campaigns.

Template uses [[templater-obsidian|Templater]] and [[dataview|Dataview]] plugins. As well as my [[Kanban (SlRvb)|Kanban]] snippet, and some [[ITS Theme]] cssclasses, but neither of these snippets are *required* to use template, just makes it look nice.

The query template for these notes are here: [[Locale Dataview Query Template]]

---
`Number:` is usually the number of the location on that map or just the order that I might want to see this note sorted in when I use a dataview query to pull up multiple Locale notes.

`Location:: ` is often a link to another location note where this Locale note is located. For example if this Locale note was for a `Store`, the location would be what city it's located in: `Location:: [[City Name]].`

%% Paste your template below %%
