This starter kit is designed to get you immediately hands-on with ways to manage your digital notes. Experiment. Learn by doing. See what methods work for you.

If you want to take notes that compound in value over your lifetime, it’s not enough to rely solely on direct links, tags, and folders. In the **Age of the `[[Linked]]` Note**, we have access to powerful thinking tools. The LYT System explores how to use Fluid Frameworks like MOCs (Maps of Content) and a Home note to elevate your thinking today—and years from now.
