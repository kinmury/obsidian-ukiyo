I have crafted these templates for my personal use, as such they are tailored made for my needs. In any case I decided to share them since most of them have been created based on other people templates, my OneNote, work notes and years of note taking.

For this to work properly, make sure you have the Core Plugin "Templates" enabled, and it does not hurt to have DataView as well
