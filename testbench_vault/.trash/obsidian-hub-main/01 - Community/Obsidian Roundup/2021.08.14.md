# 2021-08-14: Highlights Syncing & a Minimal Editor GUI
Default view modes, emoji shortcodes, & CLI tools for plugin devs.

## Plugin News

### New

- [Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/ac9) shipped their [[readwise-official|official integration plugin]] this week and it‚Äôs generating a ton of buzz. Here's the [forum thread](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/the-official-readwise-obsidian-integration-has-launched/22311/5) but basically, Readwise lets you import highlights and annotations from pdfs, rss readers, twitter, ebooks and more. It also has the best OCR highlighter for dead tree books I‚Äôve ever come across, and while checking it out again for the Roundup I discovered that they have education pricing. Their team is also super nice, too, and have been helping people out in the Obsidian Discord. You can get a month free using [this link](https://readwise.io/i/ac9) if you sync highlights to your account. Here's a pretty good overview of [what to expect from the plugin](https://medium.com/@benenewton/first-look-at-the-official-readwise-obsidian-plugin-5d553c0d0521).
- [[obsidian-pocket|Pocket integration]] plugin allows users to sync [[Pocket]] reading lists into Obsidian.
- It's now possible to use [[YAML]] to force the view-mode of a note, i.e. to set a note with a [[dataview|Dataview]] block to always open in preview mode by default. The plugin is very descriptively called [[obsidian-view-mode-by-frontmatter|Force note view mode]].
- [[macro-plugin|Macros]] lets you combine commands from the command palette, with optional delays between commands.
- Obsidian now has an [[obsidian-toggl-integration|integration with Toggl]] timers.
- The [[customizable-sidebar|Customizable Sidebar]] plugin allows you to add any command, including those of plugins, to the sidebar and assign custom icons to them. Here's information for how [developers can add icons to their commands](http://discordapp.com/channels/686053708261228577/840286264964022302/875393424918999081).
- We now have support for [[emoji-shortcodes|Emoji Shortcodes]] in Obsidian, which makes `:heart:` turn into ‚ù§Ô∏è.
- You can now [[number-headings-obsidian|automatically number headings]].
- [[alx-folder-note|AidenLx's Folder Note]] iis a bit of an update on the [[folder-note-plugin|OG]] version by `xpgo` that lets you have a folder function as a note.
- This customizable [[obsidian-linter|Linter]] plugin will let you "fix" markdown styling to be more consistent within a note.
- The new [[obsidian-wordnet-plugin|Obsidian42 - WordNet Dictionary]] is a dictionary plugin that works from the command palette instead of sidebar or right-click menu.

### Updates

- The absolutely gorgeous minimal text editor modal plugin [[cmenu-plugin|cMenu]] from the developer of [[Yin and Yang]] now has a setting for custom commands on the little ui bar.
- the original [[todoist-sync-plugin|Todoist Plugin]] released 1.8 with mobile support & a few other nice features.
- [[breadcrumbs]] has had a breaking change update that allows for multiple separate hierarchies.
- [[obsidian-git|Obsidian Git]] [v1.10.0](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git/releases/tag/1.10.0) now has submodules support.
- v1.0.3 of [[longform|Longform]] has some bugfixes.
- v1.6.0 of the [[obsidian-spaced-repetition|Obsidian Spaced Repetition]] plugin has single and multi line reversed cards function, the ability to ignore flashcards using HTML comments, and some caching improvements.
