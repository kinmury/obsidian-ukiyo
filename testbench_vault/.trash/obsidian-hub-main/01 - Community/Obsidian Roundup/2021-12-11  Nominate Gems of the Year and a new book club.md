# 2021-12-11: Nominate Gems of the Year & a new book club
National Novel Writing Month reflections, a bunch of helpful stuff for theme developers, & more tips for students.

## In The Community

-   the 400th community plugin was approved this week: [CookLang](https://github.com/deathau/cooklang-obsidian)
-   You can now [nominate your favorite plugins, content creators, & themes. Share your favorite workflows & most impressive achievements](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/01+-+Community/Events/Gems+of+the+Year+2021) in this year's "Gems of the Year" award event.
-   There's going to be [a book club hosted by history teacher Dan Allosso](https://twitter.com/AllossoDan/status/1467196021604184066) for _The Dawn of Everything_ by David Graeber & David Wengrow (which I am currently reading myself!)
-   Here's a nice reflection about [how personal knowledge management communities are like knowledge graphs](https://publish.obsidian.md/tim/40_Evergreens/Communities+are+knowledge+graphs)

## Obsidian Updates

## Plugin News

_Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat). Note, though, that this is not as safe as waiting for them to go through code review._

### New

-   You can now [sync all of your Matter](https://github.com/getmatterapp/obsidian-matter) (an iOS read-later app) highlights and notes directly to your Obsidian vault.
-   [Generic initiative Tracker for TTRPGs](https://github.com/beaushinkle/obsidian-generic-initiative-tracker) is a fork of [Initiative Tracker](https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-initiative-tracker). It aims to separate out the initiative concepts from the DnD 5e specific stuff to make it system agnostic.
-   [Regex Replace](https://github.com/Gru80/obsidian-regex-replace) provides search/replace functionality that supports regular expressions and selections.
-   [Attachment Name Formatting](https://github.com/JYC333/obsidian-attachment-name-formatting) will format all attachments in the format: `filename attachmentFormat indexNumber.xxx`
-   [Link Favicon](https://github.com/joethei/obsidian-link-favicon) will show link favicons without requiring any custom CSS.
-   [Get Info](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/Get-Info-Plugin) creates a small menu inside your status bar and shows helpful information for your chosen file.
-   [Global Hotkeys](https://github.com/mjessome/obsidian-global-hotkeys) adds support for system-wide global hotkeys.
-   You can give your [tags a file tree](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-tagfolder) like a folder system.
-   There's a new [wordpress integration](https://github.com/devbean/obsidian-wordpress).
-   You can now create markdown-based reveal.js presentations in Obsidian.

### Updates

-   [Map View](https://github.com/esm7/obsidian-map-view) 1.0.0 has a UI for editing market icons and a bunch of other cool features.
-   [MySnippets](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/MySnippets-Plugin) now lets users create new CSS snippet files within a workspace.
-   [Various Components](https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/obsidian-various-complements-plugin/releases/tag/3.2.0) v3.2.0 has some fancy new commands!

### Betas

-   [CSV Codeblock](https://github.com/M3NIX/obsidian-csv-codeblock) will render CSV codeblocks as tables.
-   [Skribi](https://azulaloi.net/obsidian-skribi/) provides dynamic, live templating features for non-destructively rendering elements inside of notes.
-   Task-Changer plugin supports both live preview and source mode now. Â You can try it by adding Quorafind/Obsidian-Task-Changer to brat now.

### Under The Radar

-   Despite the name, [commits](https://github.com/Darakah/obsidian-commits) doesn't have anything to do with git per se, it just tracks what you've worked on each day and what changed, with a bunch of different queries you can make.

### For Developers

-   The [theme dev vault](https://github.com/obsidian-community/theme-dev-vault/pull/3) has examples of asides, footnotes, citations, lists, tasks with data-task variants, etc.
-   Here's a discussion about the [limitations of codemirror 6](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/840286264964022302/914684714827251774), which is the library powering mobile & the new Live Preview mode.
-   [Theme Design Utilities](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/obsidian-theme-design-utilities) lets users emulate mobile, post a test notice, or feeze Obsidian. There's also quick access to a CSS cheat sheet that `@TFTHacker` made.

## Feature Requests
