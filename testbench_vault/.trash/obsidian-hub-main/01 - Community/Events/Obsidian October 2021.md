# Obsidian October 2021

Been thinking about making a plugin or theme but never had the opportunity to do it? October is the time!

Obsidian October is an official event brought to you by Obsidian to help you get started with making your very own plugins and themes.

## How it works

Starting now, we'll start accepting participants (abbreviated as OOers below). Anyone can participate! You'll get a special role to indicate you're participating too. You can get your role by reacting to [this message on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/702717892533157999/889615286095986688).

You can sign up any time before October 31, but we encourage you to start early so you have a higher chance to finish your project.

There will be a special channel on Discord to ask questions and chat about your progress. On the forum, there is also [a mega post for OOers to share their daily progress and learnings](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-october-2021-daily-progress-and-learnings/24472). Developers who help out will also receive a special mentor role!

## Submitting your project

Any OOer who finishes their project before the end of October 31, 2021 [anywhere on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth) can submit via [this form](https://airtable.com/shrUsaaJcOX7cEA73/) (embedded below, although it will not render if you're viewing this on GitHub). We'll be publicly celebrating O_O contributions after the event wraps up, so you might be featured on the Obsidian website, via Twitter, or elsewhere!

Also, be sure to submit your plugin and theme to our official community [plugin directory](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/community-plugins.json) or [theme gallery](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/community-css-themes.json) by submitting a Pull Request to the relevant list.

## Prizes

After October 31, 2021, the participant role will be removed and those who submitted a project will get a souvenir role for "Completed OO 2021".

The winning submissions will also be highlighted on our websites and remain accessible & visible.

The awards are as following:

### Winner
