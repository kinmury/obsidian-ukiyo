## Tips When Using Topia

**Don't disable your video.** Topia has a strange bug where if you disable it, you won't be able to view others screenshare/videos. If someone is broadcasting and you can't hear or see them, make sure to check your settings.

**Workaround:** You can just screenshare a blank notepad window if you don't want to share video of yourself or your screen. 


Also note: **Mute doesn't always work**, so be careful.


## Courtyard
When you arrive, you'll be placed in the courtyard where the Obsidian logo sits on a little pedestal.

There are multiple paths leading away from the center that have signs describing where the paths go. These signs will teleport you directly to different spaces on Topia if you click on them and select yes. 


## Event Space
The **Event Space** is where more casual [[Obsidian Community Talks|Community Talks]] or Q&A's take place. It's located South of the [[#Courtyard]] and has an arch with a sign with the [[Obsidian Community Talks]] logo.

To the left of the arch, there's a Calendar Board where you can see the upcoming talks calendar once you click on it. On the right of the arch, there's a sign that will teleport you back to the [[#Courtyard]].

Near the stage area, there's a blue banner that will display the [[Obsidian Community Talks]] page of the Obsidian Hub website.


## Work Space
The **Work Space** is where people can go to focus on whatever they're doing, either alone or sitting around others. It's located North of the [[#Courtyard]].

The far left is the Library, there are areas for people to work alone. On the far right is the Cafe area to relax and work around others. Stand near the "bar" (kitchen counter top) and it will play jazz music for you to listen to if you want some background noise while you work.


## Other Areas
Other areas are currently a work in progress. Contact `Leah#9156` on the Community Talks Topia Discord channel or ping her on the Obsidian Discord if you have questions about these areas.
