## How it works

The event works in three phases.

### Nomination

Because many themes and plugins were produced this year, we will have members of the community nominate them to limit the number of options to vote for.

If a plugin or theme has been very useful to you, please make sure they are nominated so they can be voted for after.

You can nominate yourself and your own creations as well! We encourage all creators to do that.

Before nominating, please review all the existing nominations to make sure you're not making a duplicate nomination.

#### How to nominate

Nominate by posting the required information to the corresponding forum thread:

3.  A short paragraph on why you like it or how it helps your workflow.
