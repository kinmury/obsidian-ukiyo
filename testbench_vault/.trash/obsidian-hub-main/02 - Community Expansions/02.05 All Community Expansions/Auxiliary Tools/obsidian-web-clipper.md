# Web Clipper Bookmarklet

Links: [Github](https://gist.github.com/kepano/90c05f162c37cf730abb8ff027987ca3)
Developed by: [[kepano]]

Saves articles and pages from the web (for Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and mobile browsers)

This bookmarklet creates a new Obsidian file from the main body of the web page (similar to Readability view). Alternatively you can choose to create a file from a selection, by either selecting all (`CMD+A` or `CTRL+A`), or just a portion of the page.

## Demo
You can find a demo of this bookmarklet [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy1MdjickAI)
