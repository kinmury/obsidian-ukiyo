obsidianki4 is an add-on for the digital flashcard app [[Anki]]. It enables you to import notes from your [[Obsidian]] vault into Anki to be used as flashcards for revision in a [[Spaced repetition]] workflow. It preserves both wiki-links and hierarchical tag structures.

**Note:** The development of this [[🗂️ Auxiliary Tools|third-party tool]] is currently paused, meaning the code is unmaintained for the foreseeable future. (Status: 2022-03-15)
