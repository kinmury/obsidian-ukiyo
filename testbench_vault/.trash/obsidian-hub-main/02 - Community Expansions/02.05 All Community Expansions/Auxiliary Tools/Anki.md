Anki is a free and open-source [[üóÇÔ∏è Auxiliary Tools|tool]] to create digital flashcards. It uses a [[Spaced repetition]] algorithm to help you prevent forgetting what you have learned. It lets you review information over a long period of time as revisions are spaced out based on your confidence to recall the learned content.

To integrate Obsidian into your Anki workflow, you may want to take a look at several community-developed plugins over at [[Spaced Repetition Plugins]] or consider third-party tools such as [[obsidianki4]].
