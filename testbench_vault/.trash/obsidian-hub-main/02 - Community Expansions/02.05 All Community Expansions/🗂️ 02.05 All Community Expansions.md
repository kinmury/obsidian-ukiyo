# 🗂️ 02.05 All Community Expansions

This is a comprehensive directory of **all** expansions for Obsidian made by the Community – [[🗂️ Plugins|Plugins]], [[🗂️ Themes|Themes]], [[🗂️ CSS Snippets| CSS Snippets]], and [[🗂️ Auxiliary Tools|Auxilliary Tools]]. 

Unsurprisingly, these are quite a lot! If you feel overwhelmed, you might want to browse the [[🗂️ 02 - Community Expansions|Community Expansions by category]] instead.
