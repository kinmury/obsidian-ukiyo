# Spaced Repetition Plugins

%% Add a description below this line. It doesn't need to be long: one or two sentences should be a good start. %%
Here you will find plugins which are explicitly developed with the [[Spaced repetition]] method in mind as well as those which could be used to achieve a similar workflow.

## Plugins in this category

%% Add a bullet here and link to the plugins you'd like to categorize! %%
### Built-in Review Systems
- [[review-obsidian|Obsidian Review]] lets you manually schedule entire notes for review.
- [[obsidian-recall|Obsidian Recall]] implements a spaced repetition system for reviewing information, with any spaced repetition algorithm. It tracks notes in a `.json` file and while very customizable, only allows for the review of entire notes.
- [[obsidian-spaced-repetition|Spaced Repetition]] has a built-in review system for inline flashcards and entire notes. Information on the spaced repetition system (SRS) is stored in plaintext. 
- [[obsidian-incremental-writing|Incremental Writing]] is basically spaced repetition but for writing instead of reviewing.

### Exporters
#### Integrations with [[Anki]]
- [[obsidian-to-anki-plugin|Obsidian to Anki]] enables you to create Anki flashcards from a text or markdown file. It lets you define specific deck names and tags for every folder in your vault. Not currently in active development, but a fully featured plugin with a nice wiki.
- [[ObsidianAnkiSync|Obsidian Anki Sync]] is similar to Obsidian to Anki but uses a different and more powerful markup based syntax for making flash cards.
- [[flashcards-obsidian|Flashcards]] also integrates with Anki, and has a nice wiki. Flashcards is slightly less customizable and only allows for the addition of one note's worth of cards at a time.
- [[obsidian-ankibridge|AnkiBridge]] started as a fork of Flashcards but diverged and now has a lot of other features worth checking out.

#### Other third-party tools
- [[mochi-cards-exporter|Mochi Cards Exporter]] exports markdown notes to [Mochi flashcards](https://mochi.cards/). Cards are designated via tags.
