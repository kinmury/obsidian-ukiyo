<h1 align=center>General Changes</h1>

In this section I'm gonna explain some of the difference between the *Default Theme* and the **Ukiyo Theme**. Most of the difference are the lack of icons or elements in the Workspace because you can access those functionalities through shortcuts that are already enabled by default or shortcuts that you may have to put in order to use them. 

Either way, I'll make a short explanation about the most important ones. If you see a `(*)` before a shortcut, that means its not a default shortcut but one that you need to configure before using.

## Side Dock Ribbons

The side ribbons are hidden visibly, and I'm saying *visibly* because later, on the [Features](./features.md) page, there is and option to hide for real this ribbons. We'll get there eventually, for now, by default, the ribbons won't show any icons until you hover over them. 

Once your mouse is placed on the icon, you can use said function by clicking on it.

## Side Panels

!!!info "Shortcuts"
    `(*)` - `CTRL+Q` - Toggle Left Sidebar   
    `(*)` - `CTRL+1` - Toggle Right Sidebar

Since there are "no ribbons", the way I toggle the sides is using the shortcuts mentioned earlier. These are the binding I personally choose to use, but it's up to you to decide if you want to use them or choose another ones. Also you should also take into account the plugins you use, since their shortcuts may break the ones that you already have assign for certain action.

## Certain Views

!!!info "Shortcuts"
    `CTRL+,` - Settings <br>
    `CTRL+G` - Graph View

These may seem obvious, but I had some friends that actually didn't knew about this ones (and the ones in the next section). Once they knew about them, they didn't use the icons at all.

## Note Specifics

!!!info "Shortcuts"
    `CTRL+E` - Toggle between Edit View/Live View and Preview View <br>
    `CTRL+W` - Close working note <br>
    `(*)` - `CTRL+ALT+P` - Export Note as PDF

These are the ones that I frequently use. I use them so much that I almost forgot what key bindings I used for this shortcuts because of muscle memory :laughing:.

## Change between Notes

!!!info "Shortcuts"
    `CTRL+ALT+->` - Navigate Forward <br>
    `CTRL+ALT+<-` - Navigate Backwards

These, as well as the one in the preview sections, are the most used ones. These shortcuts could also work if your mouse had additional buttons. These two buttons, often on the left side of the mouse (because most of the mouses are made for right handed people. Otherwise they should be placed on the right side if the mouse is for left handed people), also execute the same shortcuts.

Beware of this command, particularly for those who use Windows. At first, when I wasn't used to use these shortcuts, I pressed the Windows Key instead of the `ALT` key, changing the desktop environments instead of the notes. But once you are used to these shortcuts this shouldn't be an issue at all.
