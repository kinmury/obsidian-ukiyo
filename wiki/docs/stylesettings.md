<h1 align=center>Style Settings</h1>

This sections explains what are the different **Style Settings** available on the theme.

## General Settings

Here are all the settings that don't belong in any particular settings. For now, there is only one, and its called **Alternative Theme**. Here you can choose between the following themes:

- **Ukiyo** - The *default theme*.
- **Golden Coffee** - My *first* published theme. This is the one theme that I made and, even though this version of Golden Coffee isn't anything like it used to be on the first releases, I still bounce to this theme once in a while.
	- *Little Story* - If it wasn't by *SIRvB* (the designer behind the **ITS Theme**) I wouldn't have uploaded this first theme. A lot of the initial CSS knowledge that I have it's thanks to studying this theme and, once I gain enough knowledge, I started making my own stuff, even if it wasn't as cool as what the other theme creators did. [^1]
- **Golden Book** - The second and most strange theme that I've made so far. The main focus of this theme is to create a similar feel as if you where reading a book. (Or, at least, thats what I visioned, but I still thing there is a lot of space for improvement even as of today (06/07/2022)).
	- *Litte Story - Part 2* - This theme has a funny backstory. The creation of this theme begun in the early week of **Obsidian October Event 2021**. Around that time, I had learn CSS for around 4 months and half, and I felt like I had improved a lot since the first prototypes I made (like, really, my first ever theme only change the headings, bold, italics and mark colors, I really didn't knew anything about CSS :laughing:). When I read about this event I thought that it would be a great opportunity to try new stuff and to see what I could do with the knowledge I had gained over the past few months.
	- During that month, I didn't want to see anything of the Discord Server, at least not new but old stuff, so that my theme didn't incorporate anything from other themes (since I wanted to see what I'm capable of) but needed to learn how to implement those ideas that I had.
	- There where so many cool themes, like **Prism**, **Primary**, **Sanctum**, **Bubble Space**, **Things**, **Obsidian You** and surely more themes but I don't remembered them all. I knew I couldn't win, since my knowledge wasn't enough. But I did enjoy the event, since it was the first ever event I take part in.
	- In this theme was born the *Pop Ups* feature (before called `<aside>`s).
- **Alchemy** - This is the third (and I thought last) theme. The main focus of this theme was to make a dark theme, but also easy to read. I love the way it came out, but over time it became tedious to the eyes, even though I used it for a long time.
	- *Little Story - Part 3* - When this came out, I also make a re-make of the first two themes, since I didn't want to let them behind. But, over time, it became hard to keep them updated. 
	- Now that it's summer, I have more time to do stuff. And I thought of creating a new theme, where all the previews ones are part of it, so that it's easier for me to update and fix stuff, since the only thing that its different between the themes, is the color scheme itself. That how **Ukiyo** was born.

On a final note, I hope that the OGs **Golden Coffee**, **Golden Book** and **Alchemy** users like the newer version of said themes. I know they are not the same, and there are changes that not everyone may like. Soooo, in case anyone of you would love to see something from the original themes, I'm more than open and ready to implement them into this theme. Just make sure to submit the issue :wink: .

Even though I'll remove said themes from the *Community Themes* section of Obsidian, they'll still be available on their respective GitHub Repositories. But they wont be maintained, for the reasons already stated :laughing: .

## Active Line

Change the way the *active line* it's visualized.

- **Alternative Active Line** - This feature was created by *Pseudometa*, the creator of **Shimmering Focus** (the most aggressively minimalistic theme *Eleanor Konik* is aware of). Instead of having background color on the active line, you get a vertical line on the left side of the note, indicating the block you are editing at the position of your cursor.
	- **Position Right** - This setting changes the position of the vertical line. Now, instead of the left side, it stays on the right side.
	- **Both Positions** - Vertical Line on the Left and Right side of the block.
	- **Keep It** - It combined the default active line with the alternative active line settings that you have chosen.


## Hide User Interface

!!! warning
	This settings might be not suitable for *Obsidian Beginners Users*. If you are new to this app, keep using it for a while until you get use to it. If you fell confident enough, you can happily ignore this warning.
	
- **Global UI** - Hide most of the *User Interface* and, this time, not only visibly. You still need to hover over the sides to see the tools you still have at your disposal (not all of them though), but at least they won't get on the way until you do so.
- **Hide Horizontal Line** - As you may already saw, when you toggle the previews setting, a horizontal line appear at the top of the app. That line indicates where you need to place you mouse in order to show the header of the note. If you don't want it, you can hide it enabling this option.

## Fonts

For now there is one option, and it only changes to a more elegant font, regardless of the chosen theme. The font is the one that it's use to export the notes on PDF.

## CSS Classes

In this section there is NO settings. Here will be displayed the information about all the CSS Classes that this theme provides. More information in the [Features](./features.md) section.
