# Style Settings

- **[Modes](https://github.com/kinmury/obsidian-ukiyo/blob/main/docs/modes.md)** - Change the way the UI is displayed.
	- _Smooth mode_ - Creates space between the different elements.
 	- _Minimal mode_ - Compacts the interface and hides most elements.
- **[Color Scheme](https://github.com/kinmury/obsidian-ukiyo/blob/main/docs/color-scheme.md)** - Change the color palette used.
	- _Selector_ - Choose between the already existing color schemes.
 	- _Custom_ - If you choose the custom option from the selector, a list of options will appear that lets you create your own color scheme for the theme.
- **[Pop Out Callout](https://github.com/kinmury/obsidian-ukiyo/blob/main/docs/custom-callouts.md)** - Whenever you use a pop-out callout and you switch between source view to reading view, all the pop-out callout will play a slide-out animation. You can turn that off by changing the value to 0.
- **[Floating Sides](https://github.com/kinmury/obsidian-ukiyo/blob/main/docs/floating-sides.md)** - The side panels will appear above all other elements of the interface.
