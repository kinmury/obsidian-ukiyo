<h1 align=center>!! Ukiyo is being reworked !!</h1>

Hello to everyone ðŸ˜Š,

As you may know, Obsidian is officially on version `1.0.0`, and with all the new amazing features that it brings, it also destroys most of the themes that where on the app. That's why a lot of the themes (including mine) are catalogued (I'm not sure if mine is, but I personally think that it should be marked as) **Legacy Theme**. This means that my theme is no longer suitable to work with on this new Obsidian version. 

That why I worked as fast as possible to rework and adapt the theme to the new version. So I bring you the *unfinished* version `2.0.0-beta` of this theme. By "unfinished" I don't mean it's also broken (although there might be some things that don't work properly (in such case please open an issue so that I'm aware of it and fix it as soon as possible)), I mean that there is just enough content so that you can work properly with it.

For now there is only one colour scheme, the base one (Ukiyo). From here I'll be working on a number of things, such as the rest of the colour schemes, some features that are missing like the pop-ups or the floating side panels, and will also tweak the `UI` a little and some plugins.

One of the main focus that I also have is start building a proper *Style Setting* Settings. This means that I'll bring you the ability to change a lot of stuff or, at the very least, the stuff that I have change that may be interesting for you to change, like the colours of the bold, italic and mark elements for example.

In any way, I hope that this first update will help you use the new Obsidian version with a more optimised for that version theme. If you encounter any problem/issue at all with my theme, don't hesitate to ask me to fix it on the GitHub Issue page. 

Also, I'll implement a Kanban View Project on this repository so that, if you are interested, you can see what elements of the theme its being currently working on.

Finally, I want to say **Thank You** for your patience and I hope that you like the new version of this theme ðŸ˜Š
