# News
## 2022/11/12

As you may know, Obsidian had recently upload the `v1.0.0` version, which means that pretty much all of the themes need to go through a rework in order to be useful in that version (and the ones to come after that).

That's why I spend the free time that I had in order to update this theme. Sadly, I have to upload the official version sooner that I wanted since the `O_O` Submission will end soon and I don't have time to implement anything else until that date.

Even after that, I'll be busy for a while, so that means that there will be a little `hiatus` in the development/update of the theme. But also this doesn't mean that I'll stop adding/fixing stuff with the upcoming versions. I'll still be working on the theme as long as I'm using Obsidian, so sooner or later I'll implement all the stuff that could be added on this release and more (`Spoiler`: Some of this stuff have to do with `PDF` elements and the `UI`, but I won't say anything more (for now `;P`)).

And as for the submission (I'll say it as well on the submission), I'm actually won't participate to win the event, but to show to anyone that's interested on the *Creation of Themes* that it's not that hard. Yes, I know it takes time and knowledge but... doesn't it required anything that it's interesting? 

My last year submission (and the first one) was *Golden Book*. If you go to the archive repository for said Theme, look a it and compare it to its color scheme in this theme, or any color scheme of this theme for that manner, and you'll definitely will see that there is some improvement. Sure enough it isn't the best theme there is (and won't be, since every user has his own taste), but you can see the difference of someone that had 3 month worth of CSS experience and, the same person, but with almost a year worth of CSS knowledge.

Once again, I know that I have a lot to learn the this theme has a lot of room for improvement, and I'll make sure it improves to the extend of my capabilities.

And, last but not least, I want to say thank you for everyone that has help me getting started with CSS (yes, I'm looking at you SIR `;P`) and to all the user that used all of my previous themes and this one. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do and it helps you use Obsidian as comfy as possible.

# Utils

> Here is the list of all the utils that the theme provides, and by "utils" I mean all the Style Settings (`SS` for short) that the theme provide, along with all the CSS-Classes, Callouts, Tasks Icons, and all the CSS tools that I find useful.
> 
> There isn't a lot of utils for now, since I'm done with the update, not talking about all the new implementation that I want to add, but over time it will grow

> The isn't a lot of plugins here, and I'm not sure if it will grow, since I'm comfortable with only a few plugins, but if there is a Feature Request about some plugin, I'll try my best to adapt it to the theme and add it here.
