# Custom callouts
## General Metadata

You can use the following classes in the callout metadata to obtain different effects:

- `!bg` - Hides the background color
- `!icon` - Hides the icon
- `!bold` - Removes the automatic bold style of the title
- `!color` - Restores the default text color of the title
- `!title` - Hides the title
- `!content` - Hides the content
- `title-center` - Centers the title
- `content-center` - Centers the content

### Dataview

- `block-links` - Changes the list generated by a Dataview query to look like a list of blocks.

### Tables

- `table-clear` - Removes the background color and decorations from the first row of the table
- `table-index` - Removes the first cell of the first row and add the background and decoration that the first row has to all the first cells of the following rows.

### Pop Outs

- `$pop` - Converts the current callout to a pop-out. A small box (`>`) will appear on the left side of the note. Its content won't be revealed until hovered.

## Container of columns

This is not a metadata but two callout types:

- `![CONT]` - The container in which the "columns" will be stored.
- `![COL]` - The "columns" where the information will be displayed.

The idea is to create a table in which the columns will be the information that is used inside the `![COL]` callouts.
